Attach a 3 GB hard disk to Windows server. Create a single partition and format it. Now create 4 files in it. 
Then format the hard disk. 
Detach the hard disk from Windows server VM and attach it to the forensics VM.
First check the MD5 and SHA hash.
Create an image of this hard disk using dd.
Verify the image md5 and SHA hash is same as the hard disk hash.
Now detach the 3 GB hard disk from the VM.(As it is a original evidence)
Add a new 3 GB hard disk to the FOrensics VM. 
Using dd command write the image file to this new blank hard disk.
Verify the MD5 and SHA hash of the new hard disk is same as file image.
Now use photorec to recover data from the new 3 GB  hard disk. (This is how you work on the copy and not on the original evidence) 
The data will be stored on main OS hard disk
